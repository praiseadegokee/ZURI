                    <p>The Shrine was Fela’s home from home until a few weeks before his passing in 1997, when it fell into disrepair. The New Afrika Shrine, which opened in 2000, was built by his family, led by his eldest daughter, Yeni, and his eldest son, Femi. Their primary motivation was, and remains, to acknowledge and preserve the contribution Fela and the Shrine made to the local community and to the broader evolution of post-colonial Africa. Unable to reopen the original Shrine, because it stood on land leased for the duration of Fela’s life only, the family built a new one. They invested a substantial proportion of the monies received from licensing Fela’s back catalogue in the project.</p>
                    <p>There is no entrance fee for most events at the New Afrika Shrine, the doors are open 24/7, and everyone – locals and overseas visitors, rich and poor, black and white – is given the same warm welcome, often by Yeni herself when she is in town. Femi performs with his band The Positive Force every Thursday and Sunday, unless he is away on tour. His younger brother Seun appears with Egypt 80 on the last Saturday of every month, unless he is on tour. There is a popular disco night on Fridays.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The idea and concept of Felabration as an annual celebration of Fela’s music, life and times, originated from his eldest child Yeni who conceived it in 1998. With the exception of 1999, Felabration has taken place annually. Currently Felabration - organized by the Felabration Organising Committee - has grown into a mega week-long musical event in Nigeria which attracts thousands of visitors annually to the New Africa Shrine from all over the world. Felabration is an official tourist destination of The Lagos State Government who are major sponsors of the event.</p>
                <p>Over the years Felabration has attracted many high-class musical acts from all over the world. The roll call includes; Hugh Masekela, Femi Kuti, Lucky Dube, Awilo, Baba Maal, Les Nubians, King Sunny Ade, Lagbaja, Asa, TuFace, Sauti Sol, Seun Kuti and many others. A testament to the global nature of the Felabration brand is when in the year 2008, over 50 international artistes came together under the banner, African Express - from the United States, Great Britain, France and Senegal - to perform at Felabration.</p>
                <p>Every year, Felabration features an exciting lineup of artistes designed to satisfy the appetite of music lovers who throng the New Africa Shrine. The Felabration Week always runs through the week of October that includes the 15th day, ensuring that Fela’s posthumous birthday celebrations are part of the Festival. As the creator of afrobeat, social critic, political activist and champion of the underprivileged, as well as a philosopher of his own political ideology, Fela is still today, a hero to millions of people for his contributions to society. The Felabration festivals always include a range of activities attendees can engage in, such as ‘The Fela Debates’ symposium series, the Secondary Schools debate, the Afrobics Dance Competition, Art Exhibitions, Art Competition and lots more. The festivals offer an exhilarating week-long experience celebrating the iconic status of Africa’s best known musical figure, Fela Anikulakpo Kuti.</p>

                Kuti is remembered as an influential icon who voiced his opinions on matters that affected the nation through his music. Since 1998, the Felabration festival, an idea pioneered by his daughter Yeni Kuti, is held each year at at the New Afrika Shrine to celebrate the life of this music legend and his birthday. Since Kuti's death in 1997, there has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by UMG, Broadway and off-Broadway biographically based shows, and new bands, such as Antibalas, who carry the Afrobeat banner to a new generation of listeners.
